//client connections looking for a game, creating games,
//leaving games, joining games and ending games when they leave.
import { LobbyServer } from "./LobbyServer";

//Socket.io will call this function when a client connects,
//So we can send that client looking for a game to play,
//as well as give that client a unique ID to use so we can

// .sockets selects every client
